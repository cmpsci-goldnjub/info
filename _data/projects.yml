    Imagine the fun you could have when you put a group of good
    friend in a study group.  STUBY is a social study group platform
    that allows you to create and join study group with your friends,
    to offer tutoring to other students in the subjects that you
    mastered, and to meet new friends who share your hobbies outside
    of school. Study groups cultivate concentrated and helpful
    environments to boost students’ academic performance. This is
    especially useful to students who are new to the school
    environment and culture. STUBY revolutionizes traditional study
    group concept by linking it to study-assisting games and
    activities through web applications and mobile apps to engage
    students. In this new dimension of studying, STUBY incorporates
    the essence of social interactions and draw students who share
    similar hobbies together through study groups. By “stubying”
    together, STUBY could integrate the process of proactive learning
    into our daily activity!

    Our project improves the inefficient process of charitable donation by
    connecting donors and recipients and allowing for low effort,
    automatic, free exchanges between them. This is accomplished through
    the joint use of a web based and mobile services, using the same
    database. Utilizing a mobile cloud computing and distributed systems
    system, we have developed a service that can act in real time, draw
    from data from both mobile and web users, and lead the users to the
    location of the charity or donor. The service also utilizes
    geo-location data to provide users with a local view of
    charities/donors in their area as well as establishments looking for
    volunteers. All of this allows for a faster, more efficient way for
    people to conduct giving. Bringing the world together one act of
    kindness at a time.

    The goal of our application is to give people a place to do the things
    they love. Its simple and easy to use interface allows nearby people
    to communicate with each other, through the use of Google Maps. Once
    in the application, click the menu button in the bottom right, and
    then the 'add location' button. A ping will be dropped on the map,
    which you can drag around the map. Clicking the accept button brings
    you to a final page, where you have the ability to input information
    like 'name,' type of hobby, and a short description before submitting
    the ping. This allows other users to see the ping on the map.

    NOTEX is a chat application for phones (Android OS) made to keep
    drivers from texting while driving by leveraging social interactions
    with computer technologies. When a person attempts to send a text
    while driving, the message is flagged and the recipient sees a message
    informing them that the sender is currently driving. This encourages
    the recipient to postpone conversation, which in turn encourages the
    driver to wait until after the car is stopped to text.

    SafeRides offers a way for the people of a community to travel when
    they are not able to safely drive themselves. It combines the concepts
    of “designated drivers” and “mobile taxi services” to provide
    individuals with a convenient way to obtain a ride when needed. When
    the app is opened, a map view is displayed with a pin on the user’s
    current location. The user can choose to be picked up at that
    location, or they can designate a new pick-up location by searching an
    address or a location name such as “Taco Bell”, which queries their
    local area. He or she can also designate a default “Home” location in
    the Settings window. Then, the user clicks “Request”, and a
    notification is sent to nearby drivers in the area that are part of
    their network. In the future, we would like to notify the user about
    the estimated time of arrival of the driver, and to allow the user to
    specify a destination location so that the drivers are aware of this
    beforehand. The ride does not have a price, but the user can look at
    his or her history to see who drove them, and then he or she can
    donate money to that driver as a “Thank You”. This app is applicable
    and scalable to all communities. The drivers are volunteers who apply
    online to a designated community. The driver’s app interface will be
    slightly different, but they will also be able to request rides when
    needed. Due to a short amount of time, we were not able to implement
    all of the functionalities in the app that are necessary; but given
    the opportunity, we will develop it further until it is a fully-
    functioning service.

    TechKnowledge is a site created to connect those that need technology
    for learning with those that have excess electronics. Each user can
    submit a project profile which highlights the user's technological
    needs, a description of the project, and location of the user. Users
    looking to donate their excess electronics can browse project profiles
    to decide on a cause to donate to. In order to maximize efficiency,
    users in need can search for items donors have available. At the
    beginning stages of this site, TechKnowledge will only put users in
    contact with each other based on location so that donating items is
    convenient. If users are under a certain age, messages sent through
    TechKnowledge will be sent to the user's parents. By making donating
    convenient more electronics will be reaching the hands of those that
    need them rather than causing environmental harm in landfills or going
    to waste in cluttered basements across the world. TechKnowledge allows
    users to connect to promote learning through technology and
    electronics without money or availability being a factor.
