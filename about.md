## The Hackathon

S&T’s Computer Science Department is celebrating its
[Golden Jubilee](http://cs.mst.edu/50years/). One of the many exciting
Golden Jubilee events is the Hackathon for Humanity (H4H). This is a
multi-week competition for teams of S&T students, alumni, faculty, and
staff to create the most outstanding web or mobile app (iOS or
Android) that is beneficial to society. $2,000 in prize money is
available! Remote participation is fully supported and mixed teams of
for instance on campus students and remote alumni are
encouraged. Comprehensive rules, including rules for team formation,
submission, and judging, are available here on the H4H website
(<http://h4h.mst.edu/>).

### The Kickoff

The H4H Kickoff event is Thursday September 3rd 2015 12:30-1:30 PM
Central Standard Daylight Savings Time (i.e., Rolla time) in room 209
of the Computer Science Building. During this event, examples of apps
serving society will be provided, and the procedures for forming teams
and submitting entries demonstrated. This is the perfect opportunity
for Q&A and to form teams on the spot. Free food & beverages will be
provided. For remote attendees (e.g., alumni, students who just woke
up), if you just want to watch, use the passive live stream at

participate, then use
