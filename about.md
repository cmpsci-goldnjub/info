## The Hackathon

S&T’s Computer Science Department is celebrating its
[Golden Jubilee](http://cs.mst.edu/50years/). One of the many exciting
Golden Jubilee events is the Hackathon for Humanity (H4H). This is a
multi-week competition for teams of S&T students, alumni, faculty, and
staff to create the most outstanding web or mobile app (iOS or
Android) that is beneficial to society. $2,000 in prize money is
available! Remote participation is fully supported and mixed teams of
for instance on campus students and remote alumni are
encouraged. Comprehensive rules, including rules for team formation,
submission, and judging, are available here on the H4H website
(<http://h4h.mst.edu/>).

### The Kickoff

The H4H Kickoff event was Thursday September 3rd. During the event,
examples of apps serving society were provided, and the procedures for
forming teams and submitting entries demonstrated.
