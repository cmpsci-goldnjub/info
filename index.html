            Form your team of Missouri S&T students, alumni, staff,
            and faculty and make it happen! Hackathon for Humanity
            (HfH) is a great opportunity to collaborate with past and
            present Miners to create the next big thing to serve
            humanity. Develop and promote your idea for a web or
            mobile application to be judged by distinguished alumni of
            Missouri S&T and successful entrepreneurs. This is your
            chance to be recognized at the HfH awards ceremony during

              Fifty years ago, in 1965, two students became the first
              computer science majors to graduate from Missouri
              S&amp;T.  The university's name was changed the previous
              year from MSM (Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy)
              to UMR (University of Missouri - Rolla).  Looking back,
              it seems that intermediate name change was also
              heralding a whole new age of computing technology that
              has forever changed our lives and our livelihoods.  As
              we reflect on the past 50 years and look ahead to the
              future, these are our goals for the Computer Science
              Golden Jubilee:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Celebrate the past, present, and future of Computer
                Science at Missouri S&amp;T.
              </li>
              <li>
                Engage with students, faculty, alumni, industry,
                government, and others in celebration, education, and
                value creation opportunities.
              </li>
              <li>
                Promote the achievements of and partnership
                opportunities with Computer Science and Missouri
                S&amp;T.

              Hackathon for Humanity is a part of this golden

              work on projects to better our community and our
              world. To read more about the Computer Science Golden
