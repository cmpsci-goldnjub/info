## Can my team maintain code with a version control system?

Of course! We recommend it. However, we are not providing any VCS
hosting. You may use any hosting service you please, and you are
welcome to keep your code private until after submissions are
complete.

As long as your final submission meets the HfH requirements, we don't
care how you decide to maintain your code.
